                    MIGRATION is a periodic, large-scale phenomenon observed in a minority of fish species during their life cycle, involving movement relative to their original habitats. These cycles range from daily to annually, or even longer, spanning distances from a few meters to thousands of kilometers. Fish and other marine animals may migrate for reasons such as foraging, breeding, or overwintering. However, the vast majority of fish (such as salmon) die after reaching their destination; only a small minority survive.
