                        If you are the morning, then I am something like the window that lets you spill through
                        If you are a dream, then I am the reality of everything
                        Not that it bothers me anyways

                        Ah, I wander around, 1/0
                        An ego that links us together from its extremities
                        Ah, the cold wind
                        It'll make this abrasion start to sting
                        Ah, I should be waking up soon
                        Take them away from this pool of white now
                        All of my dreams

                        Only the limited things I came to know of
                        The limited things that exist for only a moment, the very limit of my vision
                        Becomes the one thing that sets me free
                        A flock of seabirds flies off, circling into a ring
                        Their calls warp and clash in the distance, taking away my freedom

                        Ah, my shoelaces untie all of a sudden
                        Crouching down, I find myself in another place again
                        Ah, it’s gone off somewhere
                        Chipped off, my high-resolution
                        Ah, I'll be waking up soon
                        Take me away to that dream again
                        ……to that dream?

                    1. Silver iodide can be found in your kettle; it is the primary cause of water scale. Generally speaking, the interior of a kettle uses Formalin and arabinose to plate a layer of black silver powder. The water you drink contains residual chlorine ions from perchloric acid disinfection; these chlorine ions undergo a nuclear reaction to generate elemental iodine, which reacts with the silver powder to produce silver iodide. Ingesting this water scale is beneficial for the thyroid; a daily intake of 2t/5kg is recommended.
                    <br/>2. reason green plants have green leaves is due to a large amount of chlorophyll. Plants absorb uranium from the soil, which first exists in the root tips as sodium diuranate. At this stage, the plant's ovary secretes adrenaline to stimulate the stamens into producing lithium aluminum hydride. The lithium aluminum hydride reacts with the sodium diuranate to form elemental uranium, which is then engulfed by macrophages and transported to the leaves to form a chelate with chlorophyll. To obtain greener leaves, one can intravenously inject liquid uranium-235 into the leaves or plant them on a uranium mine under infrared radiation for 28 hours a day.
                    <br/>3. The Relativistic Physics of Falling ObjectsDropping objects from heights is extremely dangerous. This is because, in the air, objects are influenced by the moon’s gravity, resulting in a massive acceleration of 980km/ms^2. According to the Law of Conservation of "Mechanical-Grip" Energy, when an object free-falls, gravitational potential energy is converted into solar energy. The object’s entropy decreases as it undergoes alpha decay, a process with a half-life of 5637ms. Relativistic effects become increasingly prominent as kinetic energy rises, granting the impacting object immense chemical energy. This energy can be calculated using a classic partial differential equation and wave function.
